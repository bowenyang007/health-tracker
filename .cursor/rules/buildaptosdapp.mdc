# Build a dapp on Aptos

This document provides a detailed guidline for building a dapp on Aptos.

---

### 1. Project folder structure

* Prefer using a known framework setup like `npm create vite` or `npx create-next-app`.
  * Always use `React` for the front end 
  * Prefer use `TypeScript`
* In the root folder, generate the project setup based on the chosen framework.
* Rename the `src` folder in the project folder to `frontend`, and make sure to modify all relevante references.
* Use the `frontend` folder as the place to hold all of the project frontend code.

### 2. Create the smart contract

* Create a `contract` folder in the project folder.
* Use the `contract` folder as the place to hold all of the project Move contract code.
* Generate the relevant Move smart contract files in the `contract` folder, such as the `Move.toml` file, sources folder.
* Implement any relevant smart contract code.

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

* Install the required aptos packages like `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk`, `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react`.
* Always use the latest stable versions of packages.
* Install other dependencies if required.

### 4. Setup Wallet Connector

**MCP Resources:** `wallet_provider`, `connect_wallet_dialog`, `wallet_row`

* Use the `wallet_provider` resource to setup the Wallet Adapter Provider.
* Use the `connect_wallet_dialog` resource to setup the Wallet Selector modal to show all wallets.
* Use the `wallet_row` resource to setup the Wallet connection where users can connect their wallet with the dapp.

**Important:** Always use the latest code implementation
